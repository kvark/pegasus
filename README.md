GFX + Specs framework that lets you fly

GFX is made for the command buffers to be constructed in parallel.
Specs is made to do operations on a large number of entities in parallel.
So what about using them together?

Pegasus comes to help, serving both as an example of how to organize the system flow, and as a framework.
